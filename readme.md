## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Background

Mushroom foraging is a popular activity, but it comes with substantial risks due to the challenge of distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms. Many poisonous mushrooms look similar to edible ones, which can lead to severe health issues or even death. This project leverages machine learning to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics, providing a reliable tool for foragers and minimizing the risks of accidental poisoning.

### 1.2 Importance of the Problem

The misidentification of mushrooms, especially when foraging for wild varieties, remains a significant public health concern. Since many edible and poisonous mushrooms share similar morphological characteristics, an automated system capable of distinguishing between them could help prevent accidental poisoning, making it easier and safer for people to forage mushrooms in the wild.

### 1.3 Related Research

Various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and ensemble methods, have been explored for mushroom classification. These methods rely on multiple features such as cap shape, odor, and habitat to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.

## 3. Data Understanding

### 3.1 Data Source

The dataset used is the Mushroom Classification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains 8124 mushroom samples. Each sample has 22 features, which describe different characteristics of the mushroom, such as cap shape, odor, and habitat, along with a class label indicating whether the mushroom is edible (e) or poisonous (p).

### 3.2 Features in the Dataset

The dataset includes a wide range of categorical features describing the characteristics of mushrooms. These features are as follows:

- **cap-color**: The color of the cap (e.g., brown = n, buff = b, cinnamon = c, gray = g, green = r, pink = p, purple = u, red = e, white = w, yellow = y).
- **bruises**: Whether the mushroom bruises when touched (e.g., bruises = t, no = f).

- **gill-size**: The size of the gills (e.g., broad = b, narrow = n).
- **gill-color**: The color of the gills (e.g., black = k, brown = n, buff = b, chocolate = h, gray = g, green = r, orange = o, pink = p, purple = u, red = e, white = w, yellow = y).
- **stalk-shape**: The shape of the stalk (e.g., enlarging = e, tapering = t).
- **stalk-root**: The shape of the stalk's root (e.g., bulbous = b, club = c, cup = u, equal = e, rhizomorphs = z, rooted = r, missing = ?).
- **stalk-surface-above-ring**: Texture above the ring (e.g., fibrous = f, scaly = y, silky = k, smooth = s).
- **stalk-surface-below-ring**: Texture below the ring (e.g., fibrous = f, scaly = y, silky = k, smooth = s).
- **stalk-color-above-ring**: The color above the ring (e.g., brown = n, buff = b, cinnamon = c, gray = g, orange = o, pink = p, red = e, white = w, yellow = y).

### 3.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I performed an initial exploration of the data, which included visualizations and summary statistics to uncover any patterns, trends, or anomalies in the dataset. Some of the key findings include:

- **Distribution of Classes**: The dataset is balanced, with an approximately equal number of edible and poisonous mushrooms.
- **Correlation**: Certain features, like `cap-color`, `odor`, and `gill-color`, show high correlations with the target class (edible or poisonous).
- **Feature Interdependencies**: Pair plots and heatmaps revealed some relationships between features like `cap-color` and `gill-color`, which are often indicative of the mushroom's edibility.

## 4. Data Preparation

### 4.1 Data Cleaning

The dataset was free of missing values and duplicates, simplifying the preprocessing task. The only issue that required attention was encoding the categorical features into numerical values.

### 4.2 Feature Encoding

As the dataset contained only categorical features, **Label Encoding** was applied to transform them into numeric values suitable for machine learning models. This encoding was performed for each feature, where each category was assigned a unique integer.

### 4.3 Data Splitting

The dataset was split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets to ensure that model performance could be validated on unseen data.

### 4.4 Feature Scaling

For some algorithms, such as SVM, feature scaling was necessary. However, scaling was not required for tree-based models like Random Forest, as they are not sensitive to the scale of the data.
