# Machine Learning Project Report - Mushroom Classification

**Maulana P. R.**  
**Project Domain**: Mushroom Classification

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Background
Mushroom foraging is becoming increasingly popular, but it also presents significant risks due to the difficulty in distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms. Many poisonous mushrooms resemble safe varieties closely, posing a serious threat to foragers. This project seeks to build a machine learning model to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics, providing a valuable tool for foragers and reducing the risk of accidental poisoning.

### 1.2 Importance of the Problem
Mushrooms are commonly misidentified because many edible and poisonous varieties share similar features. This can lead to serious health risks, including severe poisoning or death. An automated classification system could help individuals accurately differentiate between the two types, ensuring safer foraging and consumption.

### 1.3 Related Research
Various machine learning techniques, such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and ensemble methods, have been explored for mushroom classification. These methods rely on features like cap shape, color, odor, and habitat to identify mushrooms accurately.

## 2. Business Understanding

### 2.1 Problem Statements
The primary problem is accurately classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous. Key challenges include:
- **Challenge 1**: Similar physical traits between edible and poisonous mushrooms, making classification difficult.
- **Challenge 2**: Increasing foraging by non-experts, leading to more cases of misidentification.
- **Challenge 3**: Potentially fatal consequences of misclassification.

### 2.2 Goals
The project aims to:
- **Goal 1**: Build a machine learning model capable of classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on physical attributes.
- **Goal 2**: Develop a tool for foragers and chefs to help identify mushrooms in real-time.
- **Goal 3**: Achieve high accuracy to minimize errors in classification.
- **Goal 4**: Create a user-friendly application for broad public use.

### 2.3 Solution Statement
To meet these goals, I implemented the following solutions:
- **Solution 1**: Multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, were employed for comparison.
- **Solution 2**: Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid and random search) was applied to optimize the models.
- **Solution 3**: Performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy.

## 3. Data Understanding

### 3.1 Data Source
The dataset used is the Mushroom Classification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 8124 mushroom samples with 22 attributes, labeled as either "edible" or "poisonous."

### 3.2 Features in the Dataset
The dataset includes various categorical features, such as:
- `cap_shape`: Shape of the mushroom cap (e.g., bell, conical).
- `cap_surface`: Texture of the cap (e.g., smooth, scaly).
- `odor`: Type of odor (e.g., almond, anise).
- `gill_color`: Color of the gills.
- `stalk_surface_above_ring`: Texture above the ring (e.g., smooth, scaly).
- `habitat`: Environment where the mushroom was found (e.g., forest, grassland).

### 3.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I performed data visualization and EDA to understand the distribution of features:
- Histograms to explore feature distributions.
- Pair plots to investigate relationships between features.
- Correlation matrix to identify potential dependencies.

## 4. Data Preparation

### 4.1 Data Cleaning
The dataset contains no missing values, but all features are categorical. Therefore, label encoding was applied to convert these categorical values into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

### 4.2 Feature Encoding
I used label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical form for model compatibility. This step was crucial for algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.

### 4.3 Data Splitting
The data was split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets to ensure that the model's performance could be validated on unseen data.

### 4.4 Feature Scaling
For algorithms like SVM, I applied feature scaling to ensure all features contributed equally to the model's learning process.

## 5. Modeling

### 5.1 Models Used
I trained several machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

### 5.2 Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize model performance, I used hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search and random search. For instance, I tuned the number of neighbors for KNN and the max depth for Random Forest.

### 5.3 Model Comparison
I evaluated the models based on the accuracy metric:
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly classified mushrooms.

The Random Forest model emerged as the best performer due to its high accuracy.

### 5.4 Model Selection
The Random Forest model was selected as the best model for this task. It delivered the highest accuracy (98%).

## 6. Evaluation

### 6.1 Evaluation Metrics
I used the following metric to assess model performance:
- **Accuracy** = (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Predictions

### 6.2 Results
The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 98%, demonstrating its exceptional performance and reliability.

## 7. Conclusion

The Random Forest model demonstrated outstanding performance, achieving a classification accuracy of 98%. This model can serve as a reliable tool for mushroom foraging and help reduce the risk of accidental poisoning.
